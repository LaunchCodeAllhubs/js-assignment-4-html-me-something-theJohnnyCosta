               <h1>KORSHAK BAGELS</h1>
               <p>Located at 1700 S 10th St in Philadelphia's Passyunk Square neighborhood, Korshak has been called the "greatest bagel spot on the eastern seaboard."  That's high praise!
                  Come for the bagels but stay for the fact that you are supporting the workers who originally formed Local 80!
               </p>

               <h1>ELIXR COFFEE ROASTERS</h1>
               <p>Elixr has 3 locations in Philadelphia that have joined Local 80.  One at 207 S Sydenham St in Center City, another at 315 N 12 St (close to Chinatown), and one at 3675 Market St in West Philly.  Come for the award winning coffees and stay for the conversation (and also the strawberry milk...)

               <h1>REANIMATOR COFFEE</h1>
               <p>With a whopping 5 locations (and counting) in the Philadelphia area, Reanimator Coffee has gone from a beloved local legend to a truly unstoppable force!  Locations include 3 in the Fishtown/Port Richmond neighborhoods, one in South Philadelphia and one in West.  Many Philadelphian celebrities have worked here (including the author of this page!)
               </p>

               <h1>ULTIMO COFFEE ROASTERS</h1>
               <p>Ultimo has four locations throughout the Philadelphia area (Graduate Hospital, Rittenhouse Square, Germantown, and Newbold).  Perhaps considered the "pioneers of the Philly Coffee Scene", their baristas are among the best trained in the city (and probably the country).  Many have gone on to coffee greatness.  Superstars, the lot of them.
